# RetroSaveRename

If your ROM collection includes a lot of filenames that are inconsistent or unorganized you might be inclined to fix that.
However this will create a problem because any renamed ROMs will no longer have a save file associated with them.
This script helps "re-link" your collection of save files. That just means renaming your save files so they match the rom they're meant to be associated with. 

Note: This only deals with "hard" saves, not save states. Please save your progress in any games you care about before you rename your files. 
You could add state files to the filter and it might just work, idk I never did that.

Also it goes without saying but please back up your saves at every opportunity.
